## Discussion

We should eventually have a mailing list. We don't yet.


## Development

This app is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Install the latest stable
build (v0.10.x currently), which should install npm, then run:

```
npm install
```

To start the server, run:

```
npm start
```

Portions of this code use [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and/or
[Streamline](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs) for now, but we're open to
changing that as this project matures and expands.


## Issues

Feel free to file issues on this GitHub repo's issue tracker.
That's also where we're tracking TODOs and remaining work.
