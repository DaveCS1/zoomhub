## Development

This app is built on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Install the latest stable
build (v0.10.x currently), which should install npm, then run:

```
npm install
```

To start the server, run:

```
npm start
```

To run the tests, run:

```
npm test
```

The tests are written for [Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/)'s
[`exports` interface](http://visionmedia.github.io/mocha/#exports-interface).
They use [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) for assertions and
[Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) for API requests.

Portions of this code use [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and/or
[Streamline](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs) for now, but we're open to
changing that as this project matures and expands.
